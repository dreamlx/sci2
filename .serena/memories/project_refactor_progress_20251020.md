# Project Refactoring Progress - 2025-10-20

## ðŸŽ¯ Overall Goal
Analyze and refactor a legacy Ruby on Rails ActiveAdmin project to eliminate technical debt using a multi-phase, AI-driven approach.

## âœ… Current Status

**Phase 0: Foundation & Safety Net - COMPLETE**
- **Dependencies:** Resolved complex Gemfile conflicts to create a stable, bundled environment.
- **Code Quality Baseline:** Established a `.rubocop.yml` configuration to guide automated styling fixes.
- **Safety Net:** Generated a comprehensive RSpec test suite for the critical `Reimbursement` model, providing a safety net for future refactoring.

**Phase 1: Automated Cleanup Swarm - IN PROGRESS**
- **Strategy:** Adopted a surgical "Read -> Dispatch Agent -> Write" workflow to refactor files one by one, overcoming tool limitations with large files.
- **Progress:** Successfully refactored the most complex models (`Ability`, `WorkOrder`, `Reimbursement`), fixing hundreds of RuboCop style, layout, and complexity offenses.
- **Commits:** All changes from Phase 0 and the initial part of Phase 1 have been committed and pushed to the `feature/example-rebase` branch.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- User will compress the conversation context.
- Proceed to **Phase 2: Surgical - Service Layer Extraction**. The goal of Phase 2 is to decouple business logic from the ActiveAdmin resources and models by extracting it into dedicated Service Objects.
