# WorkOrder business logic tests have been migrated to WorkOrderService
# See: spec/services/work_order_service_spec.rb
#
# The following functionality is now tested in the service layer:
# - Status processing (approve/reject workflows)
# - State machine event handling
# - Latest work order decision principle
# - Fee detail status synchronization
# - Multi-problem type handling
# - Communication work order processing

# This file can be removed as all business logic is properly tested
# in the service layer following the new architecture pattern.
