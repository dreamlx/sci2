### 2. Ability (CanCanCan Authorization)
**File**: `app/models/ability.rb` (67 lines)
**Test File**: `spec/models/ability_spec.rb`
**Tests Added**: 73 comprehensive tests

#### Test Coverage Areas

**Super Admin Role (22 tests)**
1. General Permissions
   - Manage all resources
   - Manage specific models (Reimbursement, WorkOrder, FeeDetail, etc.)

2. Self-Protection Rules
   - Cannot destroy themselves
   - Cannot soft_delete themselves
   - Cannot restore themselves
   - Can perform these actions on other users

3. Special Operations
   - Import permissions
   - Assign reimbursements
   - Update status
   - Upload attachments
   - Soft delete/restore capabilities

**Regular Admin Role (32 tests)**
1. Read Permissions
   - Read all resources
   - Read specific models

2. Reimbursement Permissions
   - Create, update, show allowed
   - Destroy, assign, update_status, upload_attachment denied

3. WorkOrder Permissions
   - Create, update, show allowed
   - Destroy denied

4. STI Subclass Permissions
   - CommunicationWorkOrder: create, update, read (no destroy)
   - AuditWorkOrder: create, update, read (no destroy)

5. FeeDetail Permissions
   - Create, update, show allowed
   - Destroy denied

6. OperationHistory Permissions
   - Create, update, show allowed
   - Destroy denied

7. Restricted Permissions
   - No import capabilities
   - No destroy on any resources
   - No AdminUser management
   - No FeeType/ProblemType management
   - No soft delete/restore

**Deleted User Handling (9 tests)**
1. Soft Deleted Users
   - No permissions at all
   - Cannot read, create, update, destroy

2. Status 'deleted' Users
   - Same as soft deleted
   - Complete permission revocation

**Nil User Handling (2 tests)**
- Creates new AdminUser with default role
- Gets default admin permissions (read-all)

**Edge Cases (8 tests)**
1. Inactive/Suspended Users
   - Still have regular admin permissions
   - Status doesn't affect permissions unless 'deleted'

2. Permission Specificity
   - Explicit permission verification
   - Negative permission verification

#### Security Coverage
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Self-protection mechanisms
- ✅ Soft delete permission isolation
- ✅ Import operation protection
- ✅ Administrative function protection
- ✅ STI subclass permission handling
- ✅ Deleted user complete lockout
- ✅ Default user safe permissions
