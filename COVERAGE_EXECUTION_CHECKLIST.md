## Validation Checklist

After each phase:
- [ ] Run tests: `COVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec`
- [ ] Check coverage report: `open coverage/index.html`
- [ ] Verify coverage percentage increase
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass (green)
- [ ] Commit changes with descriptive message

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Build momentum with quick wins
2. **Validate incrementally** - Check coverage after each file
3. **Use templates** - Options models can share similar test structure
4. **Focus on critical paths** - Don't aim for 100% coverage on each file
5. **Document edge cases** - Note any complex scenarios for future reference
